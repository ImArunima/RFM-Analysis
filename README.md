# RFM-Analysis
Customer Segmentation using SQL and Visualization using Tableau

We explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from 
customers' past purchase behavior. We go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions.
We work on the following skills:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- MySQL group_concat Function
- Tableau
